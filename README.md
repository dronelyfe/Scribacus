# Scribacus
A trinket that makes art out of NLP data, derived from speech samples of your choice! 

# Dependencies

Scribacus uses SpeechRecognition(which relies on CMU PocketSphinx for word recognition), and Librosa for grabbing information about audio files.\
To make things a bit easier, `util/scribacus-install-dependencies.py` can sort the dependencies out for you. It only assumes that you have `pip`.\
Simply `cd` into `util/`\
and `python scribacus-install-dependencies.py`
